#Belly-Button-Challenge

## Overview
Using plotly and JavaScript, I created a dashboard which displays species of bacteria located within the belly buttons of multiple volunteers. Each volunteer can enter their identification number to see the top 10 bacterial species located within their bellybutton. If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate for the manufacture of synthetic beef, then the study's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 

## Resources
* Plotly
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* samples.json

## Analysis
To view the dashboard, open the index.html file within the challenge folder.
